	<p>I remember going to the dentist at one point and having her say that if I didn’t stop brushing my teeth so hard, I was going to need gum grafts. It was such a perfect metaphor for my personality. About eight years later I would be officially diagnosed with psychosis, bipolar and depression/addiction. I spent six weeks in a Toronto pysch ward cycling through medications until I was coherent enough to go back to my life. Or what was left of it. But I’m going to go back a bit.</p>

	<p>I was raised by two actors in a Bloor West neighborhood in Toronto, Canada. I had an agent at ten and landed union roles in television, theatre, film, animation… So much so that by the time I left high school I had paid for my university and put a down payment on a condo. I was president of student council, I landed a 5k scholarship and graduated with honors, I was a good guitar player, two years prior with a few friends, I stole a life sized fiber-glass moose from our art department, disabling the school motion detectors and hoisting it onto the roof. The story even went to the National Post. Yeah. I’m proud of all that. But I also need to illustrate why I was so surprised went to shit. Nine years later after zero success I was admitted to The Centre for Mental Health and Addiction in Toronto, delusional, and a suicide risk. When I left after six weeks, my only prospects were biweekly medication meetings with my nurse and AA. All good stuff.</p>

	<p>So what the fuck happened. Honestly, my drop was pretty tame by addiction standards. I didn’t hurt anyone or crash a car. I didn’t lose my family. Pretty much every area of my life slowly eroded and then I snapped. My thing was I drank. A lot. I did some drugs and played a ton of video games. Yeah I was addicted to gaming… I even had a woman in AA laugh in my face when I mentioned it. I had nurses tell me they wouldn’t treat me because it wasn’t a “real” addiction but it is. It’s a serious problem. I know people who lost years to gaming. Not in a gutter but in a computer chair in a basement. I remember thinking it would be better to be addicted to blow because at least people would take me seriously. Throughout all of this though, there was one constant: Tiny Danza. Working with them taught be everything I know about writing music and it was something that held me accountable. Even though I was a fuck up, I never stopped going to rehearsal. Finally I quit acting and tried to focus on recovery and music. I didn’t get better. In 2012 I had a psychotic episode.</p>

	<p>I don’t know what you know about hallucinogenic drugs but being psychotic is like being on a bad acid trip, except it can last weeks. For me it was six weeks. I did the whole thing. Bathrobe watching Mickey Mouse locked in the psych ward. TV dinners… Just to give you an idea, I thought my ex girlfriend could read my mind and was going to steal my internet banking password so every day, I wrote down a different eight digit password backwards so I couldn’t remember it. I’d call the bank from the ward payphone every day to change the pass. I carried all my id with me everywhere. Beside me when I showered. I was fkin nuts. Pretty funny now… One of my best songs was written in the middle of that.</p>

	<p>While I’m writing this I’m three years sober. I’m still on meds but I’m fine with that. The meds saved my life. I’m not going to get into how much depression hollows you out, but without meds, I would have never recovered. I know because I tried to recover for six years with no meds. I read books, I went to the gym, I’m pretty sure I joined a cult. Nothing worked. The last three years have been a return to my high school pace of work. I’ve released two solo albums and directed three music videos all while writing and performing with Tiny Danza and Dufferin ‘83. I’m on my way to founding my own record label, Red Rabbit Productions. It’s insane. That’s how fucked up mental illness and addiction are and my case was IDEAL. I had money, family support and free health care and subsidized medication. I bet I received over a $100,000 in free medical care. Can you imagine having none of that? So here’s to Canada and here’s to CAMH. Very lucky. It’s been a ride, but these days I really feel like I’m getting to the best part. Why is this my long bio? Because eventually you have to drop the brand and really talk about where the music is coming from. At least I want to. I figure it’ll make listening to the songs a bit more interesting. Thanks for reading.</p>
