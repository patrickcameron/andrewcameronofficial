			<h3>Long Biography</h3>
			<p>Somewhere along the way, Andrew Cameron lost his mind. He got his start as an actor, acquiring a Dora nomination for theatre performance and a role as a villain on Toronto’s SWAT show “Flashpoint.” All progress came to a halt in 2012 when Cameron was accepted to the emergency ward for psychosis. Penning one of his strongest songs in the hospital for his five piece band Tiny Danza, Cameron would remain inside for six weeks before moving on to release his solo tape “All That Is” and album “Coyote Off A Cliff.”  Drawing on his acting experience, Cameron would direct three music videos including the stunning “Want It All”, showcasing Toronto’s landmarks on Red Dragon camera and Phantom drone. Cameron wrote, cast, produced and directed the video about overcoming his demons. Tiny Danza continues to make huge strides, recording in the Hills with pop guru Jimmy Harry (Pink, Ke$ha Madonna), winning Toronto’s Indie week and having their single “Beat Fly” playable on Xbox’s Rock Band. Continuing to work in acting, directing and music, Cameron is steadily building towards becoming one of Canada’s strongest multidisciplinary artists. Some collaborations include two time Juno nominated Fresh Kils, Australia’s top producer M-PHAZES, and Juno nominated Rich Kidd.</p>
